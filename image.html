    <p align="left"> Seasons are distinct divisions of the meteorological year based on how the weather, 
     climate, ecology, and daylight hours change in the United States. They can also be based
     on astronomical patterns, such as solstices and equinoxes. The four seasons—spring, summer, 
     fall, and winter—follow one another regularly. Each has its own light, temperature,
     and weather patterns that repeat yearly. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter generally 
     begins on December 21 or 22. This is the winter solstice, the day of the year with the 
     shortest period of daylight.
